## Error handling
- Errors should be shown in a generic way
- Some errors that are more important to others should be handled in a custom way beneficial for the user
- All errors should be reported to us using some kind of bug / crash reporting tool

- All errors should be handled in such a way that the user knows what to do next, if possible

- [ ] Handles all types of errors related to fetching of user profile

  - App handles case where it is unable to fetch balance and does not have balance stored in local cache
  - App handles all errors thrown by API somehow 
- [ ] Handles all types of authentication errors with a clear error message to user

   
# Flows

## Authentication

- User opens app
  a. User is logged in and token is valid
    - set root view to TabBarController
  b. User is not logged in or token is invalid
    - clear any local auth data
    - set root view to LoginViewController

- User logs in
  - open auth0 webview
    a. User logs in using google account
      a. User logs in successfully
        - Fetch access token from auth0 credentials and store it in A0SimpleKeychain
        - Set login status to true using UserDefaults
        - set root view to TabBarController
      b. TODO: Define each error case that can happen and decide what do show the user on each individual case to give the user a good feedback on why the login process failed
    b. User cancels auth0 webview flow
      - auth0 webview closes automatically, do nothing else
# TODO:
- Decide on how to handle state management
  - (Apollo Graphql)[https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/]
  - (Siesta)[https://bustoutsolutions.github.io/siesta/]
- How to structure files
- Describe how to do logging and activity tracing for logging in async workloads
- Decide on crash reporting tool

# Crash Reporting Tool

## Requirements for crash reporting tool
- capture crashes
- capture install errors
- bug reporting in app with one or more of the following:
  - screenshot
  - replay screens up until crash
  - possible to draw on screenshot to highlight something
  - send text with the bug report
  - send device logs with bug report
- send device logs with crash
- possible to communicate back with user in app or other means
- integrates with other customer service portals (zendesk, freshdesk, ++)
- pricing?
- integrates with ios and android?
  - doesn't need to work on all platforms if we integrate with customer service portal
- abilitiy to manually send errors
- MOST IMPORTANT enough information when:
  - crash occurs
  - user reports bug
- shake to open and manually open
- configurable in app ui for bug reporting etc
- in app onboarding screens to tell users about the tool
