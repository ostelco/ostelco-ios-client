## Error handling
- Errors should be shown in a generic way
- Some errors that are more important to others should be handled in a custom way beneficial for the user
- All errors should be reported to us using some kind of bug / crash reporting tool
- User should be notified on errors, only if necessary, user should not need to manually refresh data, app can handle that for them, with a timer and a last fetched
- All errors should be handled in such a way that the user knows what to do next, if possible

- [ ] Handles all types of errors related to fetching of purchase history
- [ ] Handles all types of errors related to updating user profile
- [ ] Handles all types of errors related to fetching of user profile
- [ ] Handles all types of errors related to fetching top up product with a clear error message to user
  - User should see a clear error message explaining what went wrong, this should mostly be helpful for customer service if customer contacts
  - App should notify us that top up product failed to fetch
  - App handles case where it is unable to fetch top up product and does not have balance stored in local cache
  - App handles all errors thrown by API somehow
- [ ] Handles all types of errors related to fetching balance with a clear error message to user
  - If balance fails, user needs to be informed on when the last balance in the app was fetched
  - User should have a way to refresh the balance after it fails
  - User should see a clear error message explaining what went wrong, this should mostly be helpful for customer service if customer contacts
  - App should notify us that balance failed to fetch, since it's so important that the balance shows correct value at any time
  - App handles case where it is unable to fetch balance and does not have balance stored in local cache
  - App handles all errors thrown by API somehow 
- [ ] Handles all types of authentication errors with a clear error message to user

   
# Flows

## Authentication

- User opens app
  a. User is logged in and token is valid
    - set root view to TabBarController
  b. User is not logged in, token is invalid and refresh token is valid
    - set root view to TabBarController
  b. User is not logged in or token is invalid and refresh token is invalid
    - clear any local auth data
    - set root view to LoginViewController

- User logs in
  - open auth0 webview
    a. User logs in using google account
      a. User logs in successfully
        - Fetch access token and refresh token from auth0 credentials and store it using Auth0 Credentials Manager
	- Invalidate any cached state (could be a new user logging in)
        - set root view to TabBarController
      b. TODO: Define each error case that can happen and decide what do show the user on each individual case to give the user a good feedback on why the login process failed
    b. User cancels auth0 webview flow
      - auth0 webview closes automatically, do nothing else

- App receives 401 from API and tries to use refresh token to fetch a new access token
  a. Operation succeedes
    - Store new access token using Auth0 Credentials Manager
    - Repeat previous request
      a. Previous request completes
        - App continues as normal
      b. Previous request fails
        - set root view to LoginViewController
  b. Operation fails
    - set root view to LoginViewController
  c. refresh token is not defined
    - set root view to LoginViewController
  

## Refresh- and Access Token

### Access Token

Lasts for 7200 seconds = 2 hours before it has to be refreshed.
To set the expiration time:
1. login to auth0
2. navigate to APIs
3. select the *Google Endpoints API*
4. Set desired expiration time in seconds under *Token Expiration (Seconds)*
[Direct link to settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis/5ab0deded0b22601d4668b39/settings)

### Refresh Token

Is valid until explicitly revoked throuh the auth0 dashboard.

# TODO:
- Decide on how to handle state management
  - (Apollo Graphql)[https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/]
  - (Siesta)[https://bustoutsolutions.github.io/siesta/]
- How to structure files
- Describe how to do logging and activity tracing for logging in async workloads
- Decide on crash reporting tool

# Crash Reporting Tool

## Requirements for crash reporting tool
- capture crashes
- capture install errors
- bug reporting in app with one or more of the following:
  - screenshot
  - replay screens up until crash
  - possible to draw on screenshot to highlight something
  - send text with the bug report
  - send device logs with bug report
- send device logs with crash
- possible to communicate back with user in app or other means
- integrates with other customer service portals (zendesk, freshdesk, ++)
- pricing?
- integrates with ios and android?
  - doesn't need to work on all platforms if we integrate with customer service portal
- abilitiy to manually send errors
- MOST IMPORTANT enough information when:
  - crash occurs
  - user reports bug
- shake to open and manually open
- configurable in app ui for bug reporting etc
- in app onboarding screens to tell users about the tool
